# User Story Document - Requirements

## Introduction

This template creates individual user story documents following BMAD methodology. Each story represents a focused, implementable unit of work that delivers value to users while maintaining traceability to epic and PRD requirements.

**Prerequisites:**
- Epic document with story breakdown must exist
- Architecture document should be available for technical context
- PRD provides overall project context and requirements

**Usage Instructions:**
1. Copy story details from epic document
2. Break down into specific implementation tasks
3. Include relevant technical context from architecture
4. Size appropriately for single AI agent execution (2-4 hours)

## Story Definition Requirements

### Story Format Requirements
**Standard User Story Format:**
- **As a** {role} - who is the user/stakeholder
- **I want** {action} - what functionality is needed
- **so that** {benefit} - why this provides value

### Story Sizing Requirements
- Story must be completable by single AI agent in focused session
- Implementation should take 2-4 hours of development work
- Story should be "vertical slice" delivering complete functionality
- No dependencies on work from later stories or epics

### Acceptance Criteria Requirements
- Copy numbered acceptance criteria from epic document
- Criteria must be clear, testable, and unambiguous
- Each criterion defines "done" from functional perspective
- Include critical non-functional requirements where applicable
- Specify UI/UX requirements and framework adherence

## Implementation Requirements

### Task Breakdown Requirements
- Break story into specific, actionable tasks and subtasks
- Reference applicable acceptance criteria numbers for each task
- Tasks should be concrete enough for AI agent execution
- Include both implementation and testing tasks
- Maintain traceability to acceptance criteria

### Technical Context Requirements
- Include relevant information from architecture document
- Provide source tree information related to this story
- Include important notes from previous related stories
- Provide complete context so dev agent doesn't need to read architecture docs
- Include testing standards and framework requirements

## Development Process Requirements

### Status Tracking Requirements
- Story status must progress through: Draft → Approved → InProgress → Review → Done
- Status changes require explicit approval before proceeding
- Only one story should be in progress at a time
- Status updates must be tracked with timestamps

### Agent Workflow Requirements
- Scrum Master agent creates and owns story structure
- Dev agent implements and tracks progress
- QA agent reviews and validates completion
- Each agent has specific sections they own and can edit

## Documentation Requirements

### Change Log Requirements
- Track all changes made to story document
- Include date, version, description, and author
- Maintain audit trail of story evolution
- Document any scope or requirement changes

### Development Record Requirements
- Dev agent must record model/version used
- Track all files created, modified, or affected
- Document completion notes and any issues encountered
- Reference debug logs or traces generated during development

### QA Validation Requirements
- QA agent must document review results
- Include any issues found and resolution status
- Validate story meets all acceptance criteria
- Confirm testing requirements are satisfied

## Quality Assurance Requirements

### Story Validation Requirements
- Story must deliver clear user or business value
- Implementation must be testable and verifiable
- Story must be independent and not require future work
- Technical implementation must follow architecture standards

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests required for all new functionality
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Testing must follow standards from architecture document
- Test coverage must meet project requirements

### Completion Criteria Requirements
- All acceptance criteria must be satisfied
- All tasks and subtasks must be completed
- Code must pass all quality gates
- Documentation must be updated appropriately
