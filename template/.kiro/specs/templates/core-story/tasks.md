# User Story Document - Implementation Tasks

## Implementation Plan

This task list guides the creation and execution of individual user story documents following BMAD methodology. Each task ensures the story is properly structured, implemented, and validated through the complete development workflow.

## Tasks

- [ ] 1. Initialize Story Structure and Metadata
  - Create story document with proper BMAD formatting and file naming
  - Set initial status to "Draft" 
  - Extract story number, title, and epic reference from epic document
  - Establish change log with initial entry
  - Set up document sections with proper agent ownership
  - _Requirements: Story metadata and structure initialization_

- [ ] 2. Define User Story and Copy Acceptance Criteria
  - Copy user story from epic document in standard format (As a/I want/so that)
  - Validate story format includes role, action, and benefit
  - Copy numbered acceptance criteria list exactly from epic document
  - Ensure acceptance criteria are clear, testable, and unambiguous
  - Verify each criterion defines "done" from functional perspective
  - _Requirements: Story definition and acceptance criteria sections_

- [ ] 3. Break Down Story into Implementation Tasks
  - Analyze acceptance criteria and create specific implementation tasks
  - Structure tasks hierarchically with subtasks where needed
  - Reference applicable acceptance criteria numbers for each task (AC: #)
  - Ensure tasks are concrete enough for AI agent execution
  - Include both implementation and testing tasks
  - Size tasks appropriately for focused development session
  - _Requirements: Tasks/Subtasks section with checkbox format_

- [ ] 4. Provide Complete Development Context
  - Extract relevant source tree information related to this story
  - Include important architectural context from architecture document
  - Add notes from previous related stories if applicable
  - Provide complete context so dev agent doesn't need to read architecture docs
  - Include only information pulled from actual project artifacts
  - _Requirements: Dev Notes section with comprehensive context_

- [ ] 5. Define Testing Standards and Requirements
  - Extract relevant testing standards from architecture document
  - Specify test file location and naming conventions
  - Define testing frameworks and patterns to use
  - Include any specific testing requirements for this story
  - Ensure testing approach aligns with project standards
  - _Requirements: Testing section within Dev Notes_

- [ ] 6. Review and Approve Story for Implementation
  - Validate story completeness and clarity
  - Ensure all acceptance criteria are testable
  - Verify tasks provide clear implementation guidance
  - Confirm story is appropriately sized for AI agent execution
  - Update status from "Draft" to "Approved" with user confirmation
  - _Requirements: Story approval and status transition_

- [ ] 7. Execute Story Implementation (Dev Agent Phase)
  - Update status from "Approved" to "InProgress"
  - Record agent model and version used for development
  - Work through tasks and subtasks systematically
  - Mark completed tasks with checkboxes
  - Implement functionality following architecture standards
  - Write tests according to testing requirements
  - _Requirements: Dev Agent Record section population_

- [ ] 8. Track Development Progress and Changes
  - Maintain file list of all created, modified, or affected files
  - Document completion notes for each major task
  - Record any issues encountered during implementation
  - Reference debug logs or traces generated during development
  - Update change log with development progress
  - _Requirements: File List and Completion Notes documentation_

- [ ] 9. Complete Implementation and Request Review
  - Ensure all tasks and subtasks are completed (checked)
  - Verify all acceptance criteria are satisfied
  - Run all tests and ensure they pass
  - Update status from "InProgress" to "Review"
  - Provide summary of implementation in completion notes
  - _Requirements: Implementation completion and review request_

- [ ] 10. Execute QA Review and Validation (QA Agent Phase)
  - Review implementation against acceptance criteria
  - Validate code quality and architecture compliance
  - Run comprehensive testing (unit, integration as applicable)
  - Check adherence to coding standards and best practices
  - Document any issues found in QA Results section
  - _Requirements: QA Results section with review findings_

- [ ] 11. Resolve QA Issues and Iterate (if needed)
  - Address any issues identified in QA review
  - Update code and tests as needed
  - Re-run validation and testing
  - Update QA Results with resolution status
  - Repeat until all issues are resolved
  - _Requirements: Issue resolution and validation_

- [ ] 12. Finalize Story and Mark Complete
  - Ensure all acceptance criteria are fully satisfied
  - Verify all QA issues are resolved
  - Update final change log entry with completion details
  - Update status from "Review" to "Done" with QA approval
  - Confirm story delivers intended user value
  - _Requirements: Story completion and final approval_

## Validation Criteria

### Story Structure Validation
- Story follows standard user story format (As a/I want/so that)
- All acceptance criteria copied accurately from epic
- Tasks are specific, actionable, and properly sized
- Development context is complete and sufficient
- Testing requirements are clearly defined

### Implementation Validation
- All tasks and subtasks completed successfully
- Code follows architecture standards and patterns
- All tests written and passing
- File changes properly documented
- Implementation satisfies all acceptance criteria

### Quality Validation
- QA review completed with documented results

- Change log maintains complete audit trail
- Approvals obtained at required checkpoints
- Documentation is complete and accurate

### Success Metrics
- Story completed within estimated timeframe (2-4 hours development)
- Zero defects found in subsequent testing
- Implementation integrates cleanly with existing codebase
- User acceptance criteria fully satisfied
- Technical debt minimized through proper implementation
