# Planning Workflow Requirements

## Introduction

This spec template guides teams through the BMAD planning workflow, transforming initial project ideas into comprehensive Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) that serve as the foundation for technical architecture and development.

The planning workflow follows BMAD methodology principles, emphasizing iterative refinement, stakeholder collaboration, and clear documentation of project goals, requirements, and success criteria.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Project Foundation and Context

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want to establish clear project goals and background context, so that all team members understand the project's purpose and scope.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start the planning workflow THEN the system SHALL guide me to define project goals as a bullet list of desired outcomes
2. WHEN I define goals THEN the system SHALL help me articulate background context explaining what problem this solves and why
3. WHEN I document context THEN the system SHALL include a change log table to track document evolution
4. WHEN I have existing project briefs THEN the system SHALL reference them to avoid redundant information gathering
5. WHEN I lack project briefs THEN the system SHALL recommend creating one first using BMAD project brief templates

### Requirement 2: Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to capture comprehensive functional and non-functional requirements, so that the development team has clear specifications to implement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I define requirements THEN the system SHALL separate functional requirements (FR) from non-functional requirements (NFR)
2. WHEN I create functional requirements THEN each SHALL have a unique identifier starting with "FR" and clear description
3. WHEN I create non-functional requirements THEN each SHALL have a unique identifier starting with "NFR" and measurable criteria
4. WHEN I document requirements THEN the system SHALL use BMAD elicitation techniques to ensure completeness
5. WHEN requirements are unclear THEN the system SHALL prompt for clarification and examples

### Requirement 3: User Interface Design Goals

**User Story:** As a UX designer, I want to capture high-level UI/UX vision and design goals, so that the technical architecture supports the intended user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project includes UI components THEN the system SHALL capture overall UX vision and interaction paradigms
2. WHEN I define UI goals THEN the system SHALL identify core screens and views needed for the project
3. WHEN I specify accessibility requirements THEN the system SHALL offer standard options (None, WCAG AA, WCAG AAA)
4. WHEN I define target platforms THEN the system SHALL capture device and platform requirements (Web Responsive, Mobile Only, Desktop Only, Cross-Platform)
5. WHEN branding requirements exist THEN the system SHALL document style guides and visual identity requirements

### Requirement 4: Technical Assumptions and Constraints

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to document technical assumptions and constraints early in planning, so that architecture decisions align with project requirements and team capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I define technical assumptions THEN the system SHALL reference existing technical preferences from BMAD configuration
2. WHEN I make technology choices THEN the system SHALL document languages, frameworks, libraries, and deployment targets with rationale
3. WHEN I specify repository structure THEN the system SHALL choose between Monorepo, Polyrepo, or Multi-repo approaches
4. WHEN I define service architecture THEN the system SHALL document whether the system will be Monolith, Microservices, or Serverless
5. WHEN I establish testing requirements THEN the system SHALL specify testing levels (Unit Only, Unit + Integration, Full Testing Pyramid)

### Requirement 5: Epic and Story Structure

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want to break down project requirements into logically sequenced epics and stories, so that development can proceed incrementally with clear deliverables.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create epics THEN each SHALL deliver significant, end-to-end, fully deployable functionality
2. WHEN I sequence epics THEN Epic 1 SHALL establish foundational infrastructure while delivering initial functionality
3. WHEN I define stories within epics THEN each SHALL be a "vertical slice" delivering complete functionality
4. WHEN I create story acceptance criteria THEN they SHALL be clear, comprehensive, and testable
5. WHEN I size stories THEN each SHALL be completable by a single AI agent in one focused session
6. WHEN stories have dependencies THEN the system SHALL identify and note prerequisite relationships
7. WHEN I review epic structure THEN the system SHALL present complete epic lists for approval before detailed story creation
