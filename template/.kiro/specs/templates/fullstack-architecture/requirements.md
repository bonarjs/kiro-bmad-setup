# Fullstack Architecture Document - Requirements

## Introduction

This template creates a comprehensive Fullstack Architecture Document following BMAD methodology. The fullstack architecture provides a unified technical blueprint covering both backend and frontend concerns, streamlining development for modern applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

**Prerequisites:**
- PRD (docs/prd.md) must be available
- Front-end Spec (docs/front-end-spec.md) should be reviewed if available
- Technical preferences should be considered
- Project brief provides additional context

**Usage Instructions:**
1. Review all provided documents for comprehensive context
2. Make unified technology decisions for entire stack
3. Design integrated architecture covering frontend, backend, and infrastructure
4. Create single source of truth for fullstack development
