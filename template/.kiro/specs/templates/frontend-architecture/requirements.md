# Frontend Architecture Document - Requirements

## Introduction

This template creates a comprehensive Frontend Architecture Document following BMAD methodology. The frontend architecture provides detailed specifications for UI implementation, complementing the main system architecture with frontend-specific patterns and technologies.

**Prerequisites:**
- Main Architecture Document (docs/architecture.md) must be available
- PRD with UI Design Goals section should be reviewed
- UX/UI Specification document if available
- Technical preferences should be considered

**Usage Instructions:**
1. Review all provided documents for context
2. Extract frontend requirements from main architecture
3. Make framework-specific technology choices
4. Create detailed implementation patterns and standards
