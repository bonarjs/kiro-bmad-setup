# System Architecture Document - Requirements

## Introduction

This template creates a comprehensive System Architecture Document following BMAD methodology. The architecture serves as the technical blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Prerequisites:**
- Completed PRD (docs/prd.md) must be available
- Technical preferences should be reviewed
- Project brief provides additional context

**Usage Instructions:**
1. Review all provided documents before beginning
2. Work systematically through each architectural layer
3. Make definitive technology choices in Tech Stack section
4. Validate all decisions against PRD requirements

## Starter Template and Foundation

### Existing Project or Template Analysis
{Before proceeding with architecture design, analyze any starter templates or existing codebases}

**Template/Project Information:**
- Template Name: {if applicable}
- Repository/Documentation: {link if available}
- Pre-configured Technologies: {list key technologies}
- Architectural Constraints: {any limitations imposed}
- Project Structure: {existing organization patterns}

**Decision:** {Document whether using starter template or building from scratch}
