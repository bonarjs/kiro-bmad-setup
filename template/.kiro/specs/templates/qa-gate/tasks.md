  - Verify security best practices and vulnerability prevention
  - Identify code quality issues and categorize by severity
  - _Requirements: Code Quality Assessment_

- [ ] 4. Evaluate Testing Coverage and Quality
  - Review unit test coverage for all public methods and functions
  - Assess integration test coverage for component interactions
  - Evaluate test quality, assertions, and edge case coverage
  - Check test maintainability and documentation
  - Verify test execution results and identify any failures
  - Document testing gaps and coverage deficiencies
  - _Requirements: Testing Requirements assessment_

- [ ] 5. Verify Architecture Compliance
  - Review implementation against architectural patterns and decisions
  - Verify proper use of frameworks, libraries, and design patterns
  - Check component boundaries and interface adherence
  - Assess performance and scalability considerations
  - Evaluate integration with existing system components
  - Identify architecture compliance issues and deviations
  - _Requirements: Architecture Compliance assessment_

- [ ] 6. Conduct Security and Performance Assessment
  - Perform security vulnerability assessment and code review
  - Check for common security issues (injection, XSS, authentication)
  - Evaluate performance characteristics and resource utilization
  - Assess error handling and fault tolerance implementation
  - Review logging and monitoring integration
  - Identify security and performance risks
  - _Requirements: Security and Performance evaluation_

- [ ] 7. Identify and Classify Quality Issues
  - Compile all identified issues from quality assessment
  - Assign unique IDs to each issue for tracking (e.g., SEC-001, TEST-001)
  - Classify each issue by severity: low | medium | high
  - Write clear finding descriptions and impact assessments
  - Provide specific suggested actions for issue remediation
  - Include code references and locations where applicable
  - _Requirements: Issue Management Component population_

- [ ] 8. Conduct Risk Analysis and Assessment
  - Analyze overall risk profile based on identified issues
  - Categorize risks by severity: critical, high, medium, low
  - Count total risks in each category for risk summary
  - Identify must-fix recommendations for critical/high risks
  - Identify monitoring recommendations for medium/low risks
  - Assess cumulative risk impact on production readiness
  - _Requirements: Risk Assessment Component completion_

- [ ] 9. Make Gate Decision Based on Assessment
  - Evaluate overall quality assessment results and risk profile
  - Consider severity and number of issues identified
  - Assess impact on production readiness and user experience
  - Make gate decision: PASS | CONCERNS | FAIL | WAIVED
  - PASS: No significant issues, ready for production
  - CONCERNS: Minor issues present but acceptable for release
  - FAIL: Significant issues require resolution before progression
  - WAIVED: Issues present but approved for release with justification
  - _Requirements: Gate Decision Component completion_

- [ ] 10. Document Gate Decision Rationale
  - Write clear 1-2 sentence status reason explaining gate decision
  - Ensure rationale aligns with identified issues and risk assessment
  - Reference specific issues or evidence supporting the decision
  - Consider impact on story progression and development workflow
  - Document any special considerations or context factors
  - _Requirements: Decision Documentation and rationale_

- [ ] 11. Handle Waiver Process (if applicable)
  - If gate decision is WAIVED, activate waiver management
  - Document clear reason for waiving quality gate despite issues
  - Identify approval authority (Product Owner, Tech Lead, etc.)
  - Set waiver expiration date if applicable
  - Document conditions and limitations of the waiver
  - Ensure waiver is properly authorized and justified
  - _Requirements: Waiver Management Component (if needed)_

- [ ] 12. Create Action Items and Recommendations
  - For immediate action items, specify must-fix issues before production
  - Include specific code references and locations for each action
  - Provide clear remediation steps and implementation guidance
  - For future improvements, document enhancement opportunities
  - Identify technical debt and performance optimization suggestions
  - Prioritize action items by urgency and impact
  - _Requirements: Recommendations and Actions documentation_

- [ ] 13. Document Evidence and Traceability
  - Record number of tests reviewed and executed
  - Document risks identified and assessment scope
  - Map acceptance criteria coverage and identify gaps
  - Include code review scope (files, lines of code, complexity)
  - Reference any tool integration results (coverage, security scans)
  - Maintain traceability to story requirements and implementation
  - _Requirements: Evidence and Traceability documentation_

- [ ] 14. Update Story Status and Workflow Integration
  - Update story status based on gate decision
  - PASS/CONCERNS: Story can progress to next phase
  - FAIL: Story returns to development for issue resolution
  - WAIVED: Story progresses with documented exceptions
  - Notify relevant stakeholders of gate decision and status
  - Update development tracking systems and project boards
  - _Requirements: Workflow Integration and status updates_

- [ ] 15. Finalize Gate Document and Audit Trail
  - Complete all required fields in gate document
  - Validate document structure and content completeness
  - Add entry to gate history for audit trail
  - Set final timestamp and reviewer confirmation
  - Store gate document in appropriate location for tracking
  - Ensure gate document is accessible for future reference
  - _Requirements: Gate finalization and audit trail maintenance_
