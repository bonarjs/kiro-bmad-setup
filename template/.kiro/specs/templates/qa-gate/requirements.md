# Quality Gate Decision - Requirements

## Introduction

This template creates Quality Gate Decision documents following BMAD methodology. Quality gates provide systematic quality assessment and approval checkpoints throughout the development process, ensuring code quality, testing coverage, and adherence to standards before progression.

**Prerequisites:**
- Completed story implementation ready for quality review
- Architecture document with coding standards and testing requirements
- Access to code, tests, and implementation artifacts
- Clear understanding of quality criteria and acceptance standards

**Usage Instructions:**
1. Review story implementation against acceptance criteria
2. Assess code quality, testing coverage, and standards compliance
3. Identify issues and categorize by severity level
4. Make gate decision (PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL/WAIVED)
5. Document findings and recommendations for improvement

## Quality Gate Structure Requirements

### Gate Decision Requirements
{Core gate decision and status information}

**Gate Status Requirements:**
- Gate decision: PASS | CONCERNS | FAIL | WAIVED
- Status reason: 1-2 sentence summary of gate decision rationale
- Reviewer identification and timestamp
- Story reference and title for traceability

### Issue Classification Requirements
{Systematic issue identification and categorization}

**Issue Severity Requirements:**
- Severity levels: low | medium | high (fixed severity scale)
- Issue identification with unique IDs
- Finding description and impact assessment
- Suggested action and remediation guidance

### Waiver Management Requirements
{Handle exceptions and approved deviations}

**Waiver Process Requirements:**
- Waiver activation flag and reason documentation
- Approval authority identification
- Waiver conditions and limitations
- Expiration and review requirements

## Quality Assessment Requirements

### Code Quality Requirements
{Assess code quality and standards compliance}

**Code Standards Assessment Requirements:**
- Adherence to project coding standards and conventions
- Code organization and structure evaluation
- Naming conventions and documentation compliance
- Error handling and logging implementation
- Security best practices and vulnerability assessment

### Testing Requirements
{Evaluate testing coverage and quality}

**Test Coverage Requirements:**
- Unit test coverage for all public methods and functions
- Integration test coverage for component interactions
- Edge case and error condition testing
- Test quality and assertion effectiveness
- Test maintainability and documentation

### Architecture Compliance Requirements
{Verify adherence to architectural decisions and patterns}

**Architecture Assessment Requirements:**
- Compliance with architectural patterns and decisions
- Proper use of frameworks and libraries
- Component boundaries and interface adherence
- Performance and scalability considerations
- Integration with existing system components

## Risk Assessment Requirements

### Risk Identification Requirements
{Identify and categorize implementation risks}

**Risk Categories Requirements:**
- Critical risks requiring immediate attention
- High risks needing resolution before production
- Medium risks for monitoring and future resolution
- Low risks for documentation and awareness

### Risk Mitigation Requirements
{Provide guidance for risk resolution}

**Mitigation Strategy Requirements:**
- Must-fix recommendations for critical/high risks
- Monitoring recommendations for medium/low risks
- Timeline and priority guidance for resolution
- Resource requirements and implementation approach

## Evidence and Traceability Requirements

### Test Evidence Requirements
{Document testing evidence and coverage}

**Testing Evidence Requirements:**
- Number of tests reviewed and executed
- Test coverage metrics and gaps identification
- Acceptance criteria coverage mapping
- Test execution results and failure analysis

### Acceptance Criteria Validation Requirements
{Verify story acceptance criteria satisfaction}

**AC Validation Requirements:**
- Acceptance criteria coverage assessment
- Gap identification for uncovered criteria
- Functional validation and verification
- Non-functional requirement compliance

## Quality Metrics Requirements

### Quality Scoring Requirements
{Optional quantitative quality assessment}

**Quality Metrics Requirements:**
- Overall quality score (0-100 scale) if used
- Component-specific quality ratings
- Trend analysis and improvement tracking
- Benchmark comparison and target achievement

### Non-Functional Requirement Validation Requirements
{Assess NFR compliance across quality dimensions}

**NFR Assessment Requirements:**
- Security: vulnerability assessment and compliance
- Performance: response time and resource utilization
- Reliability: error handling and fault tolerance
- Maintainability: code quality and documentation

## Gate History and Audit Requirements

### Audit Trail Requirements
{Maintain complete history of gate decisions}

**History Tracking Requirements:**
- Append-only audit trail of all gate decisions
- Timestamp and reviewer for each decision
- Decision rationale and supporting notes
- Issue resolution tracking and status updates

### Gate Freshness Requirements
{Manage gate validity and expiration}

**Freshness Management Requirements:**
- Gate expiration timestamp if applicable
- Validity window for gate decisions
- Re-evaluation triggers and conditions
- Automatic expiration and renewal processes

## Recommendations and Actions Requirements

### Immediate Action Requirements
{Critical issues requiring immediate attention}

**Immediate Action Requirements:**
- Must-fix issues before production deployment
- Specific code references and locations
- Clear remediation steps and guidance
- Timeline and priority for resolution

### Future Improvement Requirements
{Non-critical improvements for future consideration}

**Future Action Requirements:**
- Enhancement opportunities and suggestions
- Technical debt identification and management
- Performance optimization recommendations
- Code quality improvement suggestions

## Integration and Workflow Requirements

### Story Integration Requirements
{Integration with story development workflow}

**Workflow Integration Requirements:**
- Story status update based on gate decision
- Integration with development tracking systems
- Notification and communication of gate results
- Handoff procedures for different gate outcomes

### Tool Integration Requirements
{Integration with development and quality tools}

**Tool Integration Requirements:**
- Code analysis tool integration and results
- Test coverage tool integration and metrics
- Security scanning tool integration and findings
- Performance monitoring tool integration and results
