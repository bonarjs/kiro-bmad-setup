# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Requirements

## Introduction

This template creates a comprehensive Product Requirements Document following BMAD methodology. The PRD serves as the foundation for all development work, defining what will be built and why.

**Usage Instructions:**
1. Review project brief if available (strongly recommended)
2. Work through each section systematically
3. Use interactive elicitation for complex sections
4. Maintain traceability between goals, requirements, and epics

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
{Define bullet list of desired outcomes the PRD will deliver if successful - user and project desires}

### Background Context
{1-2 short paragraphs summarizing the background context, what problem this solves and why, current landscape or need}

### Change Log
| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| {date} | 1.0 | Initial PRD creation | {author} |

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
{Each requirement should have an identifier starting with FR}

**Examples:**
- FR1: The system shall allow users to create and manage todo items
- FR2: The Todo List uses AI to detect and warn against potentially duplicate todo items that are worded differently

### Non-Functional Requirements
{Each requirement should have an identifier starting with NFR}

**Examples:**
- NFR1: AWS service usage must aim to stay within free-tier limits where feasible
- NFR2: System response time shall not exceed 2 seconds for standard operations

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
{High-level UI/UX vision to guide Design Architect and inform story creation}

### Key Interaction Paradigms
{Define primary interaction patterns and user flows}

### Core Screens and Views
{Conceptual high-level screens necessary to deliver PRD values and goals}

**Examples:**
- Login Screen
- Main Dashboard
- Item Detail Page
- Settings Page

### Accessibility Requirements
{Choose: None | WCAG AA | WCAG AAA | Custom Requirements}

### Branding Guidelines
{Any known branding elements or style guides that must be incorporated}

### Target Platforms
{Choose: Web Responsive | Mobile Only | Desktop Only | Cross-Platform}

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure
{Choose: Monorepo | Polyrepo | Multi-repo}

### Service Architecture
{CRITICAL DECISION - Document high-level service architecture (Monolith, Microservices, Serverless)}

### Testing Requirements
{CRITICAL DECISION - Document testing requirements (unit only, integration, e2e, manual testing needs)}

### Additional Technical Assumptions
{Throughout PRD creation, add any technical assumptions discovered that are relevant for the architect}

## Epic List

{Present high-level list of all epics for user approval. Each epic should have title and short goal statement.}

**CRITICAL: Epics MUST be logically sequential following agile best practices:**
- Each epic delivers significant, end-to-end, fully deployable increment
- Epic 1 establishes foundational infrastructure while delivering initial functionality
- Each subsequent epic builds upon previous functionality
- Err on side of fewer epics that deliver clear value

**Examples:**
- Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure - Establish project setup, authentication, and basic user management
- Epic 2: Core Business Entities - Create and manage primary domain objects with CRUD operations
- Epic 3: User Workflows & Interactions - Enable key user journeys and business processes

## Epic Details

{For each approved epic, provide expanded details with all stories and acceptance criteria}

### Epic {N}: {Epic Title}

**Epic Goal:** {2-3 sentences describing objective and value all stories will achieve}

#### Story {N}.{M}: {Story Title}

**User Story:**
As a {user_type},
I want {action},
so that {benefit}.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. {Criterion 1 - precise, testable definition of "done"}
2. {Criterion 2 - unambiguous verification basis}
3. {Criterion 3 - includes critical non-functional requirements}

{Repeat for all stories in epic}
