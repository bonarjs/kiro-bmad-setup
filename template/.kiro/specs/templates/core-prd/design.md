# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Design

## Overview

This design phase transforms the PRD requirements into a structured document ready for implementation. The design focuses on organizing requirements, validating completeness, and preparing for architecture creation.

## Architecture

### Document Structure Design
The PRD follows a hierarchical structure that supports:
- Clear traceability from goals to requirements to epics
- Interactive elicitation for complex sections
- Systematic validation through checklists
- Seamless handoff to architecture and development phases

### Requirements Organization
- **Functional Requirements**: Numbered with FR prefix for traceability
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Numbered with NFR prefix for constraints
- **Epic Structure**: Sequential epics that build upon each other
- **Story Format**: Standard user story format with comprehensive acceptance criteria

## Components and Interfaces

### PRD Components
1. **Goals and Context**: Foundation and rationale
2. **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional specifications
3. **UI Design Goals**: High-level UX vision and constraints
4. **Technical Assumptions**: Architectural constraints and preferences
5. **Epic Structure**: Hierarchical breakdown of deliverables
6. **Validation**: Checklist results and quality assurance

### Interface Design
- **Input**: Project brief, stakeholder requirements, market research
- **Output**: Structured PRD ready for architecture design
- **Validation**: PM checklist execution and approval gates
- **Handoff**: Clear prompts for UX Expert and Architect agents

## Error Handling

### Validation Strategy
- **Completeness Checks**: Ensure all required sections are populated
- **Consistency Validation**: Verify alignment between goals, requirements, and epics
- **Traceability Verification**: Confirm requirements map to epic stories
- **Quality Gates**: PM checklist execution before approval

### Error Recovery
- **Missing Information**: Prompt for required details with examples
- **Inconsistencies**: Highlight conflicts and request resolution
- **Incomplete Sections**: Provide templates and guidance for completion
- **Validation Failures**: Clear error messages with corrective actions

## Testing Strategy

### PRD Validation Testing
1. **Completeness Testing**: Verify all sections are properly filled
2. **Consistency Testing**: Check alignment across all sections
3. **Traceability Testing**: Ensure requirements map to epics and stories
4. **Stakeholder Review**: Validate against original project goals
5. **Handoff Testing**: Verify architect and UX expert can proceed with clear inputs

### Quality Assurance
- Execute PM checklist before marking complete
- Validate epic sequencing follows agile best practices
- Ensure story acceptance criteria are testable and complete
- Confirm technical assumptions provide sufficient architectural guidance
