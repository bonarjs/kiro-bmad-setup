# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Implementation Tasks

## Implementation Plan

This task list guides the creation of a comprehensive PRD following BMAD methodology. Each task builds upon previous work to create a complete, validated requirements document.

## Tasks

- [ ] 1. Initialize PRD Structure and Context
  - Create PRD document with proper BMAD formatting
  - Establish change log and version tracking
  - Review project brief if available (strongly recommend creating one first if missing)
  - Document goals as bullet list of desired outcomes
  - Write 1-2 paragraphs of background context explaining problem and solution
  - _Requirements: Goals and Background Context section_

- [ ] 2. Define Functional Requirements
  - Identify all functional capabilities the system must provide
  - Number each requirement with FR prefix (FR1, FR2, etc.)
  - Write clear, testable requirement statements
  - Ensure requirements trace back to stated goals
  - Include examples: "FR6: The Todo List uses AI to detect and warn against potentially duplicate todo items"
  - _Requirements: Functional Requirements section_

- [ ] 3. Define Non-Functional Requirements
  - Identify performance, scalability, security, and operational constraints
  - Number each requirement with NFR prefix (NFR1, NFR2, etc.)
  - Include specific measurable criteria where possible
  - Consider cost, compliance, and technical constraints
  - Include examples: "NFR1: AWS service usage must aim to stay within free-tier limits"
  - _Requirements: Non-Functional Requirements section_

- [ ] 4. Design User Interface Goals and Vision
  - Define overall UX vision to guide design decisions
  - Identify key interaction paradigms and user flow patterns
  - List core screens and views conceptually needed
  - Specify accessibility requirements (None/WCAG AA/WCAG AAA/Custom)
  - Document branding guidelines and style requirements
  - Define target platforms (Web Responsive/Mobile Only/Desktop Only/Cross-Platform)
  - _Requirements: User Interface Design Goals section_

- [ ] 5. Establish Technical Assumptions and Constraints
  - Review technical preferences from .bmad-core/data/technical-preferences.yaml if available
  - Define repository structure approach (Monorepo/Polyrepo/Multi-repo)
  - Make critical service architecture decision (Monolith/Microservices/Serverless)
  - Establish testing requirements (unit only/integration/e2e/manual needs)
  - Document any additional technical assumptions discovered during PRD creation
  - Provide rationale for each technical choice
  - _Requirements: Technical Assumptions section_

- [ ] 6. Create Epic Structure and Sequencing
  - Design high-level epic list with titles and goal statements
  - Ensure epics are logically sequential following agile best practices
  - Verify each epic delivers significant, deployable increment of functionality
  - Ensure Epic 1 establishes foundation while delivering initial value
  - Validate each subsequent epic builds upon previous functionality
  - Present complete epic list for user approval before detailed breakdown
  - _Requirements: Epic List section_

- [ ] 7. Develop Detailed Epic Breakdown
  - For each approved epic, write expanded 2-3 sentence goal statement
  - Break down epic into sequential user stories
  - Write each story in standard format: "As a [role], I want [action], so that [benefit]"
  - Ensure stories are "vertical slices" delivering complete functionality
  - Size stories appropriately for AI agent execution (2-4 hour implementation)
  - Verify no story depends on work from later stories or epics
  - _Requirements: Epic Details section_

- [ ] 8. Define Comprehensive Acceptance Criteria
  - For each user story, write clear, testable acceptance criteria
  - Ensure criteria precisely define "done" from functional perspective
  - Include critical non-functional requirements from PRD
  - Make criteria unambiguous and suitable for verification
  - Consider local testability for backend/data components
  - Specify UI/UX requirements and framework adherence where applicable
  - _Requirements: Story Acceptance Criteria_

- [ ] 9. Execute Quality Validation and Checklist
  - Review complete PRD for completeness and consistency
  - Execute PM checklist to validate PRD quality
  - Verify traceability from goals through requirements to epics and stories
  - Confirm epic sequencing follows agile best practices
  - Validate story acceptance criteria are comprehensive and testable
  - Document checklist results and any issues found
  - _Requirements: Checklist Results Report section_

- [ ] 10. Prepare Handoff Documentation and Next Steps
  - Create concise UX Expert prompt referencing this PRD for UI/UX design work
  - Create concise Architect prompt referencing this PRD for technical architecture
  - Ensure both prompts provide clear context and expectations
  - Verify PRD provides sufficient foundation for architecture and design work
  - Document any assumptions or decisions that need validation in next phases
  - _Requirements: Next Steps section_

## Validation Criteria

### PRD Completeness
- All sections properly populated with meaningful content
- Requirements numbered and traceable to goals
- Epic structure follows logical sequence
- Stories sized appropriately for implementation
- Acceptance criteria comprehensive and testable

### Quality Standards
- PM checklist executed successfully
- Stakeholder review and approval obtained
- Technical assumptions provide clear architectural guidance
- Epic sequencing enables incremental value delivery
- Handoff documentation enables smooth transition to next phases

### Success Metrics
- Architect can create technical architecture from PRD
- UX Expert can design user experience from PRD
- Development team can understand scope and priorities
- Stakeholders can validate requirements match their needs
- Project scope is clearly defined and bounded
